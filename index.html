            <h1>Hi Baby Shark!</h1>
            <p>
                Happy Birthday, baby! Since you told me not to greet you on social media, let me do it in the nerdiest way I could think of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alam mo ba kung bakit hindi kita kayang gawing variable? Kasi constant ka na sa puso ko. ❤️
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, okay, baka corny na, haha, but I just want to take a moment to tell you how incredibly grateful I am to have you in my life. 
                You've made me smile more than I ever thought possible, you've made me laugh, 
                and most importantly, you've made me feel completely comfortable being myself with you. 
                You mean so much to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                You've helped me see myself in a different light, and that's something I'll always be thankful for. 
                Getting to see all the different sides of who you are makes me even more sure that I want to be a part of your journey, 
                to share both the quiet moments and the big adventures with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the new year approaches, I can't help but feel excited knowing I'll get to spend not just the months ahead, but the entire year with you. 
                I look forward to everything we'll experience together every laugh, every challenge, every milestone. 
                Thank you for being you, and for making my life so much better just by being in it. ❤️
            </p>
